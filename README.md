#### Description
A physics based chain reaction created to perform a simple task. The task is placing a cherry on top of an ice cream. This is achieved by first having a wrecking ball start a series of toppling dominos that fall down a set of stairs and push a ball. The ball then bounces on a series of trampolines, including jumping through a ring of fire, and then landing on a slide. As the ball slides down the slide it bounces off a variety of objects and finishes by colliding with a box being held by a balloon. The balloon then takes off and lifts the box towards the ice cream. Once above the ice cream a cherry is dropped from the box onto the ice cream. The user can observe the chain reaction by moving along a catwalk via a controllable capsule object with a first person camera.
